THRESH;0;DEFAULT: 0 - A BSA-normalized datapoint is considered valid, if it is above THRESH (this means for THRESH = 0: all on-zero datapoints). Values which are not above this threshold are set to NA at the start points. Please see the Arguments_Explanation sheet in the MeCuP_Arguments_EXPLAINED.xlsx file for an explanation of SPmean filtering.
SPmean_filtering;both;"DEFAULT: ""both"" - ""TRUE"": SPmean filtering is done, ""FALSE"": Only no-filtering run is done, ""both"": no-filtering and filtering run are done in this order. Please see the Arguments_Explanation sheet in the MeCuP_Arguments_EXPLAINED.xlsx file for an explanation of SPmean filtering.                                                                                                                                                          "
NORM;NA;DEFAULT: NA - NA or any temperature used below the maximal temperature. Samples below this temperature will not be considered and samples at this temperature will be used as the start point for start point normalization according to the SPmeanNORM selection. Please see the Arguments_Explanation sheet in the MeCuP_Arguments_EXPLAINED.xlsx file for an explanation of SPmean normalization.
SPmean_THRESH_type;percent;"DEFAULT: ""percent"" - Option: ""absolute"". Please see the Arguments_Explanation sheet in the MeCuP_Arguments_EXPLAINED.xlsx file for an explanation of SPmean filtering."
SPmean_THRESH;50;"DEFAULT: 50 with SPmean_THRESH_type being set to ""percent"". - Options: SPmean_THRESH_type = ""percent"" and e.g. SPmean_THRESH = 50 for 50%; SPmean_THRESH_type = ""absolute""  and e.g. SPmean_THRESH = 2 for 2 samples. The number of absolute samples needs to be at least one below the number of repeats. Please see the Arguments_Explanation sheet in the MeCuP_Arguments_EXPLAINED.xlsx file for an explanation of SPmean filtering. "
SPmeanNORM;Control;"DEFAULT: ""Control"" - Options: ""Control"", ""treat"" or ""both"" (first run of the script is ""Control"", second run is ""treat""). If ""treat"" is selected, the mean of the BSA normalized measurements at the selected start point of each treatment/control are used for normalizing all other BSA normalized measurements of the treatment/control. If ""Control"" is selected the respective mean of the control measurements at the selected start point is used for SP normalization of all datapoints. Please see the Arguments_Explanation sheet in the MeCuP_Arguments_EXPLAINED.xlsx file for an explanation of SPmean normalization & filtering."
PLOT;ALL_and_Tm50_NO;"DEFAULT: ""ALL_and_Tm50_NO"" - Options: ""TRUE"", ""FALSE"", ""Tm50_NO"", ""ALL_and_Tm50_NO"". ""TRUE"" will produce a plot for each protein if it is not excluded in the filtering step. The png files are stored in ""output_detailed/plots_all"". ""Tm50_NO"" creates only those plots in the ""output"" directory in which the LOESS curves' 95% range does not overlap for at least one treatment and the control. ""ALL_and_Tm50_NO"" combines both options and ""FALSE"" will not produce any plot.  "
